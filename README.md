## Preface
It is no fun to be dyslexic while Wordle continues to dominate casual 
conversation. If only there was some way to both feel superior and ruin it 
for everyone else...

# Is this cheating?
Using this system is only cheating as long as you acknowledge that having an
extra circuit in your brain to easily parse and recognize the order of letters
in words is also cheating.

If that is not enough for you, then think of it like a simulation to help
you test and hone your Wordle skills. All modern chess is informed by
simulation.
