## Preface
It is no fun to be dyslexic while Wordle continues to dominate casual 
conversation. If only there was some way to both feel superior and ruin it 
for everyone else...

# Is this cheating?
Using this system is cheating only if you acknowledge that having an
extra circuit in your brain to easily parse words and recognize letter ordering
is *also* cheating.

If that is not enough for you, then think of it as a simulation to help
you test and hone your Wordle skills. Because all modern chess is informed by
simulation, and Wordle is completely equivalent to chess, right?
